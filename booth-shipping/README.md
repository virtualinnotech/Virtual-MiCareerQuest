# Booth shipping backend (140 slots, real integration)

The one piece of "real" backend in the whole project. This is a small
Cloudflare Worker (with a static assets binding, D1, and R2) that runs on
Cloudflare's free tier, and does exactly one job: let an employer design a
booth in the existing 3D studio and ship it straight to a slot,
first-come-first-served, off a single shared link -- no separate claim step.

Built originally as a classic Cloudflare Pages project (a `functions/`
directory with file-based routing). Cloudflare's dashboard now provisions
everything as a plain Worker instead, so `src/index.js` is a thin router
that dispatches to those same handler files unchanged and falls through to
the static asset binding for everything else -- see "Files" below.

## How it works

- **One link, no accounts.** Employers open `design.html` (the existing
  booth studio, `MiCareerQuest-Ship-to-Venue-v13.html`, unmodified except
  for its "Ship to venue" button). They fill in company name, contact
  email and industry -- fields the studio already had -- design their
  booth, and hit Ship. The email is their whole "identity": no password,
  no per-employer link to distribute. Coming back later with the same
  email routes them straight back to editing their own booth.
- **Claim-and-upload in one call.** `functions/api/ship.js` claims a slot
  for this email if it doesn't have one yet, then stores the real
  exported GLB -- there's no separate "claim a spot" page in the real
  flow; opening the studio and shipping IS the whole thing.
  `functions/api/claim.js` still exists standalone too, for a lightweight
  "check open spots first" page or for testing without the full 3D studio.
- **First-come-first-served, race-safe.** The claim is a single atomic SQL
  statement (`UPDATE ... WHERE rowid = (SELECT ... LIMIT 1) RETURNING ...`,
  shared by claim.js and ship.js via `claimOrRecognize()` in `_lib.js`).
  D1 serializes writes to a database, so two employers submitting in the
  same instant cannot land on the same slot number -- proven by firing 25
  concurrent claims at a 20-slot sector (see "Tested" below).
- **Reads scale for free, independent of writes.** `functions/api/manifest.js`
  -- what the student game will fetch -- and `functions/booths/[[path]].js`
  -- which serves the actual GLB files -- are both edge-cached via the
  Cache API. Employers shipping booths (rare, low volume) hit the database
  and R2; students loading the venue (the actual traffic spike) mostly hit
  Cloudflare's cache, no matter how many of them there are.
- **`design.html` is served from R2, not as a static asset.** It's a
  ~62MB single-file export of the booth studio, and Cloudflare's static
  asset serving (both the old Pages product and the current Workers+assets
  model) caps individual files at 25MB -- a hard platform limit, discovered
  the hard way against a real deploy. `sync:design-page:*` uploads it to R2
  at dev/deploy time instead, and `src/index.js` streams it back out for
  `GET /design.html`. R2 has no such per-object limit.
- **No-shows get a placeholder, on your schedule.** `functions/api/admin/fill-demo.js`
  is a manual action (call it with the admin key whenever you decide
  design season is over) that converts any still-`open` slots to a
  generic "demo booth" so no sector has a gap on fair day. The admin
  page's **Demo** column drives it (see "Admin page" below).

## Still ahead

- **140 slots, evenly split** across the 5 sectors that already exist in
  the venue (30/30/30/20/30 -- Manufacturing, Health Science,
  Agribusiness, Construction, Information Technology). Edit
  `SECTOR_COUNTS` in `db/generate-seed.js` and re-run `npm run db:seed:gen`
  once you know the real per-sector employer counts -- nothing else
  changes.
- **The student venue reads the manifest on its own.** `venue-frame.html`
  detects when it's loaded standalone (top-level, not inside the studio's
  iframe) and fetches `GET /api/manifest` itself, placing every shipped
  booth from `/booths/<sector>/<slot>.glb`. The employer's own local
  preview still uses the original `SHIP_BOOTH` -> `venueFrame` postMessage
  path for instant feedback while designing -- the two paths don't
  interfere with each other.

                             unreferenced, kept around as a testing scrap
```

There are exactly two real links given out: `/vendor` (employer booth
builder) and `/student` (student fair), plus `/admin.html` for the
organizer only. They serve the same pages as `/design.html` and
`/venue.html`, which keep working (the pages' own redirects use them).
`/Student`, `/vendor/` and similar are redirected to the exact short path,
because the pages load their assets by relative path. `/` is not a third
public page -- it 302s straight to `/student`. It used to serve a standalone mock claim page from
before the real studio existed; that page posted plain JSON to
`/api/ship`, which has expected a real multipart GLB upload for a long
time, so it was a dead, broken link and has been removed.

## Admin page

`/admin.html` lists every slot -- sector, status, company name,
contact email, when it shipped -- with a search box and, per slot:
**Edit in studio** (opens `/design.html?admin_sector=...&admin_slot=...`
in a new tab, loading that employer's saved design straight into the
studio so the organizer can add a link or fix something on their
behalf and ship it again -- no need for the employer's email), **Edit
email** (fixes a typo so an employer who lost track of the address
they used can be looked up again), and **Reset slot** (deletes their
uploaded GLB/project files from R2 and frees the slot back to `open`,
e.g. to let them start over, or to undo a mistaken/duplicate entry).
It also has a **Sector capacity** panel -- see "Dynamic booth
capacity" below.

**Demo** column: a switch on every empty slot puts a demo booth there
(switch it off to empty the slot again); the **Fill** switch above the
column header puts one in every empty slot, and off removes them all.
Employer slots have no switch, and the server refuses a demo booth in
one. Demo booths are 30 real booth-editor designs (5 per sector, from
`demo-booths/generate.cjs`), shipped with the site as static files under
`/demo-booths/`, so they need no R2 uploads and download once per design
however many slots use them. Use them to run the full venue before the
employers ship, then turn Fill off.

**Find a student's code**: students save their progress under a journey
code (see "Student journeys" below). If one forgets theirs, search by first
name, school or part of the code, check the school and when they last
played, and read them the code.

**Booth file check**: every time the slot list loads, the page checks
that each booth in the fair points at a file that exists. Any that don't
get a red **file missing** tag and are listed above the table, because
students' games leave those booths out. A demo slot is fixed by switching
its Demo off and on; an employer booth by **Edit in studio** and shipping
again.

**One booth can't stop the fair.** The student game tries each booth
file three times (a download that sends nothing for 20 s counts as a
failed try), then falls back to the employer's original upload if the
optimized copy is what failed (`/api/manifest` gives each optimized booth
a `fallbackUrl`). A booth that still won't load is left out and the venue
opens without it; the browser console lists it as "Booth left out of the
venue".

**Booth editing** (lock): once every employer has finished, lock it
before students play. While locked, `/api/ship` and `/api/claim` answer
423 with "Booth editing is closed..." (the studio shows that message), so
nothing in the fair can change while students are in it. Unlock any time.
The flag is one small R2 object, so it needs no database migration.
(The header button that clears the admin key is labelled **Sign out**.)

**Optimize booths for students** (needs booth editing locked): the
browser downloads every shipped booth and posts back a student copy:
textures used by two or more booths go to `booths/library/` once (the
studio embeds the same material maps in every export), logos and photos
are saved losslessly at the exact size the venue draws them, and the
file is gzipped. The venue (`expandShippedBooth162` in venue-frame.html)
rebuilds the full booth from that. Geometry is byte-identical and every
texture draws pixel-identical; 150 test booths went from 722 MB to the
size in CRASH-LAG-FIX-crash162.md. Student copies and library files are
named by content hash, so they are cached for a year by the edge and by
students' browsers. The employer's original upload is never touched:
**Undo optimization** points every slot back at it instantly, and an
employer re-shipping (after an unlock) does the same for their booth --
run Optimize again before the fair.

It's a plain static page (small enough to sit directly in `public/`,
unlike `design.html`/`venue.html`) that calls the
`functions/api/admin/*.js` endpoints above, all gated by the same
`x-admin-key` header check `fill-demo.js` already used. The page asks
for that key once and keeps it in `sessionStorage` (cleared on tab
close, never written to disk) for the rest of that browser tab.

**`ADMIN_KEY` is not in `wrangler.toml` at all.** It's set once as a
real secret in the Cloudflare dashboard (Worker -> Settings ->
Variables and Secrets), which is also the *only* place it lives --
committing it to `wrangler.toml` would mean the next git-triggered
deploy re-applies whatever's in that file and silently overwrites the
real secret. For local `wrangler dev`, create a `.dev.vars` file
(gitignored) with `ADMIN_KEY=dev-only-change-me` instead.

## Student journeys

When the student fair opens, before the screen tour, students choose **Start
my journey** (first name, last initial, school; they get a code like
`K7PQ-2MXD` to write down) or **Continue my journey** (type the code; their
missions, booth answers and rewards come back and the tour is skipped). On a
computer that already has a journey the screen offers to continue it, or
"Not you? Start a new journey". Progress saves in the background whenever it
changes (and once more when the page closes), but only after the student has
confirmed who they are, so a shared computer never overwrites a journey that
was continued somewhere else. The code stays on a chip under the logo, in the
Missions panel and on the certificate; closing the tab asks first and shows
the code unless the student chose **Finish for today**.

The `journeys` table (code, first name, last initial, school, progress JSON,
percent, dates) is created by the Worker on first use, so it needs no
migration. Journeys nobody has played for 60 days are deleted. Codes have 8
characters with no 0/O, 1/I/L or U. The game's code is in `journey166/`;
`?journey=0` on the student link skips the screen.

## Showing the fair on another website

The `/student` link can be embedded in a school or event website with an
iframe. Anywhere but inside the booth studio it runs as the student fair
(QA panels hidden, booths from the manifest, journey screen and tour). If the
browser blocks storage for embedded pages (private windows, some school
settings), the visit keeps its saves in memory and journey codes still save
progress to the server. A full-size frame works best, for example
`<iframe src="https://<your-worker>/student" style="width:100%;height:90vh;border:0" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>`.

## Dynamic booth capacity

Each of the venue's 5 sectors has a fixed floor area (the physical
building/curtain walls, never moved by any of this) but only a
default ~150 hand-placed booth positions total across all of them
(30/30/30/20/30 seeded today, out of 31/31/31/31/26 actually laid
out -- see `../venue-frame.html`'s `DISCOVERY_LAYOUT`). The **Sector
capacity** panel on `/admin.html` lets an organizer grow (or shrink)
how many slots a sector has, up to a hard per-sector cap
(`SECTOR_MAX_CAPACITY` in `set-capacity.js`, currently 71/75/70/72/61
-- verified by exhaustive simulation of the layout generator below,
comfortably covering 180-200+ employers total).

- **Growing** a sector inserts new `open` rows (`set-capacity.js`).
  `../venue-frame.html` reads each sector's live total from
  `GET /api/sectors` at boot and, only for a sector whose requested
  total exceeds what the hand-placed layout already has room for, runs
  a procedural generator (`regenerateDiscoveryLayout` /
  `layoutGenerateSector` in `../venue-frame.html`) that packs new
  booth anchor points in rings around each sector's fixed landmark
  sculptures, then along its perimeter, shrinking the *default* booth
  footprint (and, isolated from that, the ambient crowd's rendered
  size via `crowdVisualScale` -- never the player's own collision/
  camera scale) as needed to fit. The walking-aisle gap never shrinks
  -- it's tied to the visitor's real, unscaled collision width.
- **Staying at or shrinking back within** a sector's original
  hand-placed count leaves that sector's layout completely untouched
  (byte-identical to the authored positions) -- growth is additive,
  never a wholesale replacement of the hand-tuned look.
- **Shrinking** only removes the highest-numbered slots, and only if
  every one of them is still `open`; it refuses (naming the blocking
  slot) rather than silently evicting a claimed or shipped booth.
- An existing shipped booth whose saved position no longer exists
  after a regeneration is automatically re-seated into a new valid
  spot the next time it's loaded (`allocateDiscoveryPlacement`'s
  existing "older layout" fallback in `../venue-frame.html` -- this
  was already there for handling schema/version changes, and covers
  this case for free).

The generator is duplicated (not imported) in two places that must be
kept in sync if its constants ever change: `../venue-frame.html`
(`LAYOUT_*` constants, runs in the browser) and
`functions/api/admin/set-capacity.js` (`SECTOR_MAX_CAPACITY`, a
precomputed cap so the backend can refuse an impossible request before
touching the database at all).

`design.html` is NOT a file in `public/` -- it's uploaded to R2 by
`npm run sync:design-page:local` / `:remote` from
`../MiCareerQuest-Ship-to-Venue-v13.html`, and `src/index.js` streams it
back out for `GET /design.html`. This is the real employer link once
deployed.

The studio itself (`../studio-frame.html`, the iframe the design page
embeds) has the actual integration: `shipToLiveVenue()` builds a
`multipart/form-data` POST to `/api/ship` with the exported GLB, contact
email, industry and booth name, fired from the existing "Ship to venue"
button alongside (not instead of) its original local-preview behavior.
`../MiCareerQuest-Ship-to-Venue-v13.html` embeds that studio, and
separately embeds `../venue-frame.html` (the venue itself, for the
studio's own local "Walk venue" preview tab) the same way -- two base64
blobs, `<script id="studio-source">` and `<script id="venue-source">`.
Editing either directly in `v13.html` isn't practical (each is a single
~65MB line), so a change belongs in `../studio-frame.html` or
`../venue-frame.html` and then gets re-spliced in with
`../splice-studio.sh` / `../splice-venue.sh` -- each finds its tag,
replaces only the base64 content between it and the closing
`</script>`, and verifies the decoded result matches the edited file
byte-for-byte before overwriting `v13.html`.

## Run it locally (no Cloudflare account needed)

```
npm install
npm run db:seed:gen                 # writes db/seed.sql from SECTOR_COUNTS
npx wrangler d1 execute micareerquest-slots --local --file=db/schema.sql
npx wrangler d1 execute micareerquest-slots --local --file=db/seed.sql
npm run dev                         # uploads design.html to local R2, then wrangler dev
```

Then open http://localhost:8788/design.html and use the actual booth
studio -- click "Use sample company" to fill the form instantly, then
"Ship to venue". http://localhost:8788/venue-preview.html shows what
landed, reading the same `/api/manifest` endpoint.

To reset the mock data back to all-open:
`npx wrangler d1 execute micareerquest-slots --local --file=db/seed.sql`

## Tested (this pass)

- **The whole thing, again, after the Pages-to-Workers pivot**: rebuilt
  `src/index.js` + `wrangler.toml` for the Workers+assets model (Cloudflare's
  dashboard provisions Workers now, not classic Pages, and `wrangler pages
  deploy` fails against it with a misleading auth error), moved
  `design.html` to R2 after hitting the real 25MB static-asset limit
  against an actual deploy attempt, then re-ran every check below against
  local `wrangler dev` and confirmed identical results.
- **Real browser, real studio, real export**: drove `design.html` with
  Playwright/Chromium, clicked "Use sample company" then "Ship to venue",
  and captured the actual `POST /api/ship` the studio fired -- 200,
  `{"sector":"Manufacturing","slotNumber":1,"assetUrl":"/booths/manufacturing/1.glb"}`.
  Fetched that URL back and confirmed with `file` that it's a genuine
  ~4MB "glTF binary model, version 2" -- the studio's real export, not a
  stub -- and that the manifest correctly shows the sample company name.
- **Claim-if-needed inside ship**: shipping with no prior claim on that
  email claims a slot and uploads in the same call; re-shipping the same
  email overwrites the same slot (`taken` count stays 1, not 2) instead
  of creating a duplicate.
- **Sector names with spaces** ("Information Technology") round-trip
  correctly: `ship.js` slugs the sector for the R2 key /
  `/booths/<slug>/<n>.glb` URL, avoiding a real bug this surfaced where
  the raw name broke the URL <-> storage-key match.
- 25 concurrent claim requests fired at a 20-slot sector: exactly 20
  unique slots assigned (1-20), the other 5 correctly rejected as "full"
  -- no double-assignment.
- Admin fill-demo rejected without the key (401), fills all remaining
  open slots when authorized.
- The manifest's edge cache was observed serving a pre-fill snapshot
  until it expired -- confirms the caching the scaling story depends on
  is actually active, not just configured.

## Deploying for real (once you have a Cloudflare account)

```
npx wrangler d1 create micareerquest-slots        # paste the printed database_id into wrangler.toml
npx wrangler r2 bucket create micareerquest-booths
npx wrangler d1 execute micareerquest-slots --remote --file=db/schema.sql
npx wrangler d1 execute micareerquest-slots --remote --file=db/seed.sql
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_KEY                  # pick a real secret, not the dev default
npm run deploy                                      # uploads design.html to R2, then wrangler deploy
```

If deploying through Cloudflare's dashboard (Git-connected Worker) instead
of the CLI: set the **Build command** to
`npm install && npm run sync:design-page:remote`, the **Deploy command**
to `npx wrangler deploy` (the dashboard's own default -- not
`wrangler pages deploy`, which targets a different, older product and
fails with a misleading authentication error against a Worker), and the
**Root directory** / **Path** to `booth-shipping`.

**Production branch: `main`.** (Earlier builds came from a Claude working
branch; the full game is on `main`.) The one build command above does
everything through npm hooks: `presync:design-page:remote` copies the game
files into `public/` (`scripts/sync-forklift.cjs`; those copies are not
committed), and `postsync:design-page:remote` uploads the student page
(`venue.html`) and the game files too big for Cloudflare's 25 MB static-asset
limit to R2. Those big files are listed in `public/.assetsignore` (so the
asset upload skips them), uploaded by `scripts/upload-large-assets.cjs` to
`static/<path>`, and served by `src/index.js` with edge caching.
`wrangler.toml`'s `[build]` runs the copy again before every deploy, so a
deploy can never upload an empty `public/`.
